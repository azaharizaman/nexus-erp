## Executive Summary

**nexus-crm** is a progressive, headless CRM engine for Laravel that scales from basic contact tracking to enterprise customer relationship management. Built on the Nexus ERP **Maximum Atomicity** principle, it provides a completely independent, testable, and reusable customer management foundation that integrates seamlessly with the Nexus ERP ecosystem.

### The Problem We Solve

CRM packages typically force organizations into difficult trade-offs:

- **Simple tools** (like basic contact managers) lack the depth required for growth and scaling
- **Enterprise systems** (Salesforce, HubSpot, Microsoft Dynamics) are complex, costly, and create vendor lock-in
- **Tight coupling** to specific frameworks makes CRM logic difficult to reuse and test

### Our Solution: Progressive Disclosure Architecture

We solve these challenges through a **progressive disclosure model** that scales with your needs:

| Level | Time to Setup | Capability | Database Required |
|-------|--------------|------------|------------------|
| **Level 1** | 5 minutes | Basic CRM - Add `HasCrm` trait, manage contacts in-app | No (model attributes) |
| **Level 2** | 1 hour | Sales Automation - Database-driven leads, opportunities, pipelines, campaigns | Yes (dedicated tables) |
| **Level 3** | Production-ready | Enterprise CRM - AI insights, automation, integrations, compliance (GDPR) | Yes (advanced features) |

---

## Core Philosophy & Architectural Alignment

The nexus-crm package embodies core Nexus ERP architectural principles:

| Principle | Implementation in nexus-crm |
|-----------|---------------------------|
| **Maximum Atomicity** | Complete CRM domain in single package; zero dependencies on other Nexus packages |
| **Independent Testability** | Entire package testable in isolation with only Laravel framework dependencies |
| **Progressive Disclosure** | Start simple (Level 1), grow into complexity as needed (Level 2/3) |
| **Backwards Compatibility** | Level 1 code continues working after upgrading to Level 2/3 |
| **Headless Backend** | Pure API/CLI interface; no blade views or frontend dependencies |
| **Framework Agnostic Core** | Core business logic (`src/Core/`) has zero Laravel dependencies |
| **Contract-Driven Design** | All integrations via contracts; can swap implementations (e.g., email providers) |
| **Event-Driven Architecture** | Emits domain events for cross-package communication (e.g., `LeadCreatedEvent`) |
| **Extensible by Design** | Plugin system for custom fields, integrations, automations, and conditions |

### Why This Approach Wins

**For Mass Market Users (80%):**
- Quick setup - get started in minutes
- No database overhead for basic usage
- Easy learning curve - progressive complexity
- Fits naturally with existing Laravel models

**For Enterprise Users (20%):**
- Lead scoring and qualification pipelines
- Rich integrations (email, webhooks, API)
- Advanced analytics and reporting
- GDPR compliance and data governance
- Scalable data handling for millions of records

- `role_check` - Verify user has specific role
- `permission_check` - Verify user has specific permission

- `majority` - >50% of assigned users must approve

## Integration with Nexus ERP Ecosystem

The nexus-crm package integrates seamlessly with other Nexus ERP packages while maintaining atomic independence:

### Integration with nexus-tenancy

**Purpose:** Multi-tenant data isolation for CRM entities

**Integration Points:**
- All CRM tables include `tenant_id` foreign key
- `BelongsToTenant` trait applied to all CRM models
- Global scope automatically filters by current tenant
- Tenant context set via `TenantManager` contract

```php
use Nexus\Tenancy\Contracts\TenantManagerContract;
use Nexus\Tenancy\Traits\BelongsToTenant;
use Nexus\Crm\Traits\HasCrm;

class Lead extends Model
{
    use HasCrm, BelongsToTenant;
    
    // Automatically scoped to current tenant
    // No manual tenant_id filtering needed
}
```

### Integration with nexus-audit-log

**Purpose:** Comprehensive audit trail for all CRM activities

**Integration Points:**
- `HasActivityLogging` trait on all CRM models
- Automatic logging of state changes, transitions, assignments
- Custom log names per entity type: `crm_lead`, `crm_opportunity`
- Audit data accessible via `$instance->getActivityLogs()`

```php
use Nexus\AuditLog\Traits\HasActivityLogging;

class CrmInstance extends Model
{
    use HasActivityLogging;
    
    protected function configureActivityLogging(): array
    {
        return [
            'log_name' => 'crm_instance',
            'log_attributes' => ['state', 'stage', 'assigned_to'],
            'log_only_dirty' => true,
        ];
    }
}
```

### Integration with nexus-settings

**Purpose:** Configurable CRM behavior per tenant/user

**Integration Points:**
- CRM configuration stored in settings system
- Per-tenant lead assignment rules
- Per-user notification preferences
- Global CRM feature toggles

```php
use Nexus\Settings\Facades\Settings;

// Get tenant-specific lead assignment rule
$assignmentRule = Settings::get('crm.lead_assignment_rule', $tenantId);

// Get user-specific notification preferences
$notifyOnNewLead = Settings::get('crm.notify_on_new_lead', $tenantId, $userId);
```

### Integration with nexus-sequencing

**Purpose:** Automatic numbering for leads, opportunities, quotes

**Integration Points:**
- Lead numbers: `LEAD-{YYYY}-{0000}`
- Opportunity numbers: `OPP-{YYYY}-{0000}`
- Quote numbers: `QUOTE-{YYYY}-{0000}`

```php
use Nexus\Sequencing\Actions\GenerateSerialNumberAction;

// Generate lead number
$leadNumber = GenerateSerialNumberAction::run('LEAD-{YYYY}-{0000}');
// Result: "LEAD-2025-0001"
```

### Integration with nexus-workflow

**Purpose:** Advanced workflow automation for complex CRM processes

**Integration Points:**
- CRM stages can trigger workflow instances
- Workflow approvals can advance CRM stages
- Shared workflow engine for state management
- Event synchronization between packages

**Note:** Both nexus-crm and nexus-workflow are independent but can interoperate via events and contracts.

### Atomic Package Principles Applied

**Zero Hard Dependencies:**
- nexus-crm does NOT require any other Nexus package to function
- nexus-crm defines contracts it needs (e.g., `TenantManagerContract`, `ActivityLoggerContract`)
- The Nexus ERP orchestrator (`nexus/erp`) binds concrete implementations when packages are present
- nexus-crm uses contracts without knowledge of concrete implementations from other packages

**Contract-Based Communication:**
```php
// In CrmServiceProvider
public function register(): void
{
    // Define contracts that nexus-crm needs
    // NOTE: Do NOT bind concrete implementations from other packages here.
    // The orchestrator (nexus/erp) is responsible for binding contracts to implementations.
    
    // Example: Use contracts if available
    if (interface_exists(TenantManagerContract::class)) {
        // The orchestrator will have bound the concrete implementation
        // We simply use the contract interface
        $tenantManager = $this->app->make(TenantManagerContract::class);
        // Use $tenantManager as needed, without knowledge of its concrete class
    }
    
    // Optional integration with audit logging
    if (interface_exists(ActivityLoggerContract::class)) {
        $activityLogger = $this->app->make(ActivityLoggerContract::class);
        $this->enableActivityLogging($activityLogger);
    }
}
```
