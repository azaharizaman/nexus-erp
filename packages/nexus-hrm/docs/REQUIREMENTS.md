# nexus-hrm Package Requirements

**Package Name:** `nexus/hrm`  
**Namespace:** `Nexus\Hrm`  
**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Status:** Design Phase  
**Created:** November 15, 2025  
**Updated:** November 15, 2025

## Executive Summary

Complete Human Resource Management atomic package implementing Employee Lifecycle Management, Leave & Attendance, Performance Management, Disciplinary Tracking, Training & Certifications, and HR Analytics following the **Maximum Atomicity** architectural principles.

### Architectural Context

**Atomic Package Compliance:**
This package MUST adhere to Maximum Atomicity principles defined in the [System Architectural Document](../../../docs/SYSTEM%20ARCHITECHTURAL%20DOCUMENT.md):
- ✅ **Headless Design** - Contains only domain logic, no presentation layer
- ✅ **Independent Testability** - Complete test suite runnable with `composer test` 
- ✅ **Zero Cross-Package Dependencies** - Cannot directly depend on other Nexus packages
- ✅ **Contract-Based Communication** - External integration via interfaces and events
- ✅ **Laravel Actions Integration** - Business logic exposed via orchestration layer

**Orchestration Pattern:**
- Presentation layer (HTTP/CLI) handled by `Nexus\Erp` orchestration using Laravel Actions
- Package provides domain logic and contracts; orchestration provides API endpoints
- Integration testing performed at orchestration level, not within atomic package

**Why This Package:**
Human Resource Management components are consolidated because they:
1. **Share tight domain coupling** - Leave balances depend on employee contracts, performance reviews reference disciplinary records
2. **Have constant data flow** - Employee lifecycle changes trigger leave balance recalculations, attendance affects performance reviews
3. **Cannot function independently** - Employee master data required by all HR submodules
4. **Share organizational semantics** - All use same organizational structure from nexus-backoffice
5. **Violate atomicity if separated** - Would require complex cross-package choreography for simple leave approvals

**Internal Modularity Maintained:**
- Namespace separation (`Nexus\Hrm\EmployeeManagement`, `Nexus\Hrm\LeaveManagement`)
- Bounded contexts with clear internal interfaces  
- Domain events for internal component communication
- Separate repositories and services per subdomain

## Architectural Compliance

### Maximum Atomicity Requirements

| Requirement | Status | Implementation Notes |
|-------------|---------|---------------------|
| **No HTTP Controllers** | ✅ Must Comply | Controllers moved to `Nexus\Erp\Actions\Hrm\*` |
| **No CLI Commands** | ✅ Must Comply | Commands converted to Actions in orchestration layer |
| **No Routes Definition** | ✅ Must Comply | Routes handled by `Nexus\Erp` service provider |
| **Independent Testability** | ✅ Must Comply | Complete test suite with Orchestra Testbench |
| **Zero Package Dependencies** | ✅ Must Comply | Communication via contracts and events only |

## Integration Requirements

### Internal Package Communication

| Component | Integration Method | Implementation |
|-----------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Nexus\Backoffice** | Event-driven & Contract | Listen to `EmployeeCreatedEvent` from backoffice; use `OrganizationServiceContract` for hierarchy queries |
| **Nexus\Workflow** | Service contract | Use `WorkflowServiceContract` for leave/disciplinary approvals, performance review routing |
| **Nexus\Tenancy** | Event-driven | Listen to `TenantCreatedEvent` for default leave policy setup |
| **Nexus\AuditLog** | Service contract | Use `ActivityLoggerContract` for all employee lifecycle changes |
| **Nexus\Settings** | Service contract | Use `SettingsServiceContract` for HR policies, leave rules, working hour configurations |

### API Contracts Definition

```php
// Package defines contracts for external services
interface OrganizationServiceContract {
    public function getDepartment(string $departmentId): ?Department;
    public function getManager(string $employeeId): ?Employee;
    public function getSubordinates(string $employeeId): Collection;
}

interface WorkflowServiceContract {
    public function submitForApproval(string $type, array $data): WorkflowInstance;
    public function getApprovalStatus(string $instanceId): WorkflowStatus;
}

// Orchestration layer binds implementations
class ErpServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider {
    public function register(): void {
        $this->app->bind(OrganizationServiceContract::class, BackofficeIntegrationService::class);
        $this->app->bind(WorkflowServiceContract::class, WorkflowEngineService::class);
    }
}
```

---

## Orchestration Layer Integration

### Laravel Actions Implementation

The presentation layer is handled by `Nexus\Erp\Actions\Hrm\*` following the Laravel Actions pattern:

```php
// Atomic package provides business logic
namespace Nexus\Hrm\Services;
class LeaveManagementService {
    public function submitLeaveRequest(SubmitLeaveData $data): LeaveRequest {
        // Domain logic implementation
        // - Validate balance
        // - Create request
        // - Submit to workflow
    }
}

// Orchestration layer exposes via Actions  
namespace Nexus\Erp\Actions\Hrm;
class SubmitLeaveRequestAction {
    use AsAction;
    
    public function handle(SubmitLeaveRequestRequest $request): LeaveRequest {
        return app(LeaveManagementService::class)->submitLeaveRequest(
            SubmitLeaveData::fromRequest($request)
        );
    }
    
    // Can be invoked as HTTP, CLI, Job, Event Listener
    public function asController(SubmitLeaveRequestRequest $request) { 
        return $this->handle($request); 
    }
}
```

### Event-Driven Architecture

```php
// Package publishes domain events
namespace Nexus\Hrm\Events;
class LeaveRequestSubmittedEvent {
    public function __construct(
        public LeaveRequest $leaveRequest,
        public Employee $employee
    ) {}
}

// External packages subscribe via orchestration layer
class ErpEventServiceProvider extends EventServiceProvider {
    protected $listen = [
        LeaveRequestSubmittedEvent::class => [
            NotifyManagerListener::class,
            UpdateLeaveBalanceListener::class,
        ],
    ];
}
```

| **PR-HRM-002** | Leave balance calculation with complex rules | < 200ms |
| **PR-HRM-003** | Monthly attendance report generation (1000 employees) | < 5 seconds |
| **PR-HRM-004** | Performance review data aggregation (department-level) | < 2 seconds |
| **PR-HRM-005** | Real-time leave balance check during request submission | < 100ms |

## Dependencies

### Framework Dependencies
```json
{
    "require": {
        "php": "^8.3",
        "laravel/framework": "^12.0"
    },
    "require-dev": {
        "orchestra/testbench": "^10.0",
        "pestphp/pest": "^2.0",
        "pestphp/pest-plugin-laravel": "^2.0"
    }
}
```

### Service Contracts
External dependencies MUST be abstracted behind contracts:

| Service | Contract Interface | Bound In Orchestration |
|---------|-------------------|----------------------|
| Activity Logging | `ActivityLoggerContract` | `Nexus\Erp\ErpServiceProvider` |
| Organization Structure | `OrganizationServiceContract` | `Nexus\Erp\ErpServiceProvider` |
| Workflow Engine | `WorkflowServiceContract` | `Nexus\Erp\ErpServiceProvider` |
| Settings Management | `SettingsServiceContract` | `Nexus\Erp\ErpServiceProvider` |

find src -name "*Controller*" -o -name "*Command*" | wc -l  # Should be 0
grep -r "Nexus\\\\" src/ | grep -v "Nexus\\Hrm"           # Should be empty

# 3. Verify contract dependencies only
composer show --tree | grep nexus                          # Should show none
```
