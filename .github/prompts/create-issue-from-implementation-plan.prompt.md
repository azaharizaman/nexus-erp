# Create GitHub Issue from Implementation Plan

Create GitHub Issues for the implementation plan at `${file}`.

## Process

1. Analyze plan file to identify phases
2. Check existing issues using `search_issues`
3. Create new issue per phase using `create_issue` or update existing with `update_issue`
4. Use `feature_request.yml` or `chore_request.yml` templates (fallback to default)

## Requirements

- One issue per implementation phase (Each implementation plan may have one or more phases)
- Clear, structured titles and descriptions that ensure the implementation plan phase is fully understood
- Appropriate labels (feature/chore) based on phase type
- Include only changes required by the plan
- Verify against existing issues before creation

## Issue Content

- Title: Use code like PRD-01-Phase-01-Feature-Description
- Description: Phase details, requirements, and context. Make sure Issue description link backs to the implementation plan file and phase section. To keep the context clear and Issue Description concise, summarize the phase details effectively or make a checklist that link back to the exact lines in the implementation plan file.
- Labels: Appropriate for issue type (feature/chore)
