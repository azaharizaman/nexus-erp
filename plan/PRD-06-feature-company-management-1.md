# Introduction

![Status: Planned](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-Planned-blue)

This implementation plan details the integration of the Company Management system for the Laravel ERP using the `azaharizaman/laravel-backoffice` package. The Company Management module enables multi-level organizational hierarchy management, company registration details, tax information, and company status tracking. This module is foundational for the Backoffice domain and provides the organizational structure for the entire ERP system.

## 1. Requirements & Constraints

**Core Requirements:**
- **REQ-001**: Integrate `azaharizaman/laravel-backoffice` package for Company model
- **REQ-002**: Support parent-child company relationships for multi-level hierarchy

- **REQ-004**: Implement company status management (Active, Inactive, Suspended)
- **REQ-005**: Support unlimited depth in company hierarchy
- **REQ-006**: Extend package Company model with ERP-specific functionality if needed
- **REQ-007**: Create RESTful API endpoints for company CRUD operations
- **REQ-008**: Implement CLI commands for company management
- **REQ-009**: Apply tenant isolation to all company records
- **REQ-010**: Support company contact information storage
- **REQ-011**: Enable company logo and branding storage

**Security Requirements:**
- **SEC-001**: Apply tenant scope to all company queries to prevent cross-tenant access
- **SEC-002**: Implement authorization policies for company management operations
- **SEC-003**: Restrict company hierarchy modifications to authorized users only

**Performance Constraints:**
- **CON-001**: Company hierarchy queries must complete in under 50ms
- **CON-002**: Support minimum 100 companies per tenant
- **CON-003**: Parent-child relationship resolution must be optimized with eager loading

**Integration Guidelines:**
- **GUD-001**: Use package's Company model as base, extend only when necessary
- **GUD-002**: Apply BelongsToTenant trait to enable multi-tenancy
- **GUD-003**: Integrate with Office Management for location assignment
- **GUD-004**: Follow package documentation for model usage and configuration

**Design Patterns:**
- **PAT-001**: Use repository pattern for company data access layer

- **PAT-003**: Apply nested set or closure table pattern for efficient hierarchy queries
- **PAT-004**: Use resource classes for API response transformation

## 3. Alternatives Considered

**ALT-001: Custom Company Model vs Package Integration**
- **Approach**: Build company management from scratch without package
- **Rejected**: Package provides well-tested hierarchy management and reduces development time
- **Rationale**: Package integration ensures consistency and leverages existing functionality

**ALT-002: Adjacency List vs Nested Set for Hierarchy**
- **Approach**: Use nested set (left/right values) for hierarchy instead of adjacency list
- **Selected**: Follow package's default approach (likely adjacency list with closure table)
- **Rationale**: Package handles hierarchy efficiently; custom optimization not needed for MVP

**ALT-003: Single Company Table vs Separate Entity Types**
- **Approach**: Separate tables for different company types (HQ, subsidiary, branch)
- **Rejected**: Single table with type field provides flexibility and simplifies queries
- **Rationale**: Polymorphic approach adds unnecessary complexity for current requirements

## 4. Dependencies

**Internal Dependencies:**
- **DEP-001**: Core.001 - Multi-Tenancy System (tenant_id foreign key, BelongsToTenant trait)
- **DEP-002**: Core.002 - Authentication & Authorization (Sanctum, Spatie Permission)
- **DEP-003**: Core.003 - Audit Logging (LogsActivity trait, activity log queries)

**External Package Dependencies:**
- **DEP-004**: `azaharizaman/laravel-backoffice: dev-main` - Base package for Company model
- **DEP-005**: `spatie/laravel-activitylog: ^4.0` - Audit logging functionality
- **DEP-006**: `lorisleiva/laravel-actions: ^2.0` - Action pattern implementation

**Why dev-main stability?**
The `azaharizaman/laravel-backoffice` package is an internal package under active development alongside this ERP system. Using `dev-main` allows us to track the latest features and fixes during the development phase. Once the package and ERP system stabilize, we'll transition to tagged releases for production deployments.
