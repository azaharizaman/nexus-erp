## What Remains

**Status**: All 21 implementation plans have been successfully created. 

**Next Steps**: 
1. Begin implementation starting with Core Infrastructure (PRD-01 through PRD-05)
2. Follow dependency sequence outlined in README.md
3. Execute tasks systematically with progress tracking
4. Update plan statuses from "Planned" to "In Progress" to "Completed" as work progresses

## Implementation Pattern

All 21 plans follow this consistent structure:

### 1. Analysis Phase (Completed)
- Reviewed source requirements in PHASE-1-MVP.md
- Identified key entities and relationships
- Determined package vs custom implementation
- Mapped dependencies on Core infrastructure

### 2. Planning Phase (Completed)
- Defined all requirements (REQ, SEC, CON, GUD, PAT)
- Broke into logical implementation phases (8-15 phases per plan)
- Created detailed task breakdown (56-178 tasks per plan)
- Designed test coverage (20-40 tests per plan)

### 3. Documentation Phase (Completed)
- Listed all files (30-40 files typical per plan)
- Documented alternatives considered
- Identified risks and assumptions
- Linked dependencies and related specs

### 4. Validation Phase (Completed)
- Ensured template compliance
- Verified task atomicity
- Checked deterministic language
- Validated test coverage

## Dependency Sequencing

All plans completed with clear dependency hierarchy:

```
✅ Core Infrastructure (PRD-01 to PRD-05)
         │
         ├─> ✅ Backoffice Domain (PRD-06 to PRD-09)
         │   └─> Required by: Staff assignment in other modules
         │
         ├─> ✅ Inventory Domain (PRD-10 to PRD-13)
         │   └─> Required by: Sales and Purchasing for item references
         │
         ├─> ✅ Sales Domain (PRD-14 to PRD-17)
         │   └─> Can proceed in parallel with Purchasing
         │
         └─> ✅ Purchasing Domain (PRD-18 to PRD-21)
             └─> Can proceed in parallel with Sales
```

**Recommendation**: Implement in sequence:
1. Core Infrastructure (Weeks 1-2)
2. Backoffice (Week 3)
3. Inventory (Weeks 4-5)
4. Sales + Purchasing in parallel (Weeks 6-9)
